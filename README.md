# First Jetpack Compose Basic Projects

Welcome to the **First Jetpack Compose Basic Projects** repository! In this repository, I've explored the fundamentals of Android app development using Jetpack Compose. Here's what you'll find:

## What I Learned

1. **Introduction to Kotlin**: I gained a solid understanding of Kotlin programming concepts, which laid the foundation for building Android apps.

2. **Setting Up Android Studio**: I installed Android Studio and set up my development environment to kickstart my journey.

3. **Building a Basic Layout**: I created a simple Android app with a user interface that displays text and images. This helped me grasp the essentials of UI design.

4. **Working with UI and State**: I learned how to handle user interactions, manage app state, and automatically update UI components when data changes.

5. **Displaying Lists and Material Design**: I built apps that display lists of data, added click listeners, and enhanced the UI using Material Design principles.

## Note
The Manifest file needs to be updated manually to view all the created activities. ðŸ˜Š

**Adding Activities to Your AndroidManifest.xml File**

1. **Birthday Wish Activity**:

2. **Compose Article**:

3. **TaskManager Activity**:

4. **Compose Quadrant**:
    
5. **Business Card Activity**:

## To do so, follow below steps:
- First, ensure that you've already implemented the **BirthdayWishActivity** in your code.
- Open your **AndroidManifest.xml** file (usually located in the **app/src/main** directory).
- Inside the `<application>` section, add the following line:
    ```xml
    <activity android:name=".BirthdayWishActivity" />
    ```
- Replace `.BirthdayWishActivity` with the actual package and class name for your birthday wish activity.
   

Remember to replace the placeholders (e.g., `.BirthdayWishActivity`) with the actual package and class names corresponding to each activity. Once you've made these changes, your app should be able to navigate to these activities. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“±

Best of luck with your Jetpack Compose journey! ðŸ˜Š
